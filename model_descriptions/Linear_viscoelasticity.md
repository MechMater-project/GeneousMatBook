# Linear viscoelastic matrix or/and fillers

For any linear viscoelastic consitutive phase, one may define the complex moduli
$ X^* = X' + j X''$ with $X'$ the storage modulus and $X''$ the loss modulus of $X\in\{G,K,E,\nu...\}$ with $j^2=-1$.

Applying the elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle from Hashin [Z., Hashin, 1970. Complex moduli of viscoelastic composites. I. General theory and application to particulate composites. Int. J. Solids Struct. 6, 539-552], the analytical solutions obtained in linear elasticity extend to the linear viscoelasticity when the elastic parameters are replaced by the complex ones.
